This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using machine learning and parallel 
processing to improve efficiency. It involves image preprocessing, feature extraction (GLCM & LBP)
and training classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to distinguish between tumor-positive and tumor
negative cases. Parallelization is applied to speed up computationally expensive tasks like image
processing, feature extraction, and model training. The model's performance is evaluated using
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By optimizing these processes, the system ensures faster and 
more accurate brain tumor detection, making it valuable for medical diagnostics
